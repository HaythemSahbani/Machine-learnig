# Machine learning university project

Assessing the intensity of physical activities is an important task e.g., for medical or sport applications. The goal of this project is to compare two fundamentally distinct approaches, **classification** and **regression**, to address the intensity estimation task.

  1. Use the [PAMAP2 physical activity monitoring dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PAMAP2+Physical+Activity+Monitoring), including data from 18 activities and 9 subjects. Rely on activity-defined MET-values as approximate activity intensity ground truth. The goal is to classify samples into the three intensity classes light, moderate, or vigorous eff ort activities.
  2. Implement the AdaBoost.M1 algorithm. Use a boosted decision classifi er for the classifi cation approach.
  3. Implement the least squares and the logistic regression methods, use them for the regression approach.
  4. Compare the classifi cation and regression approaches.
